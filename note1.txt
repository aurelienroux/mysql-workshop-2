    LEFT JOIN clients ON expenses.client_id = clients.id
    LEFT JOIN cities ON clients.city = cities.name;

SELECT SUM(amount) FROM expenses GROUP BY client_id;
select client_id, SUM(amount) form expenses GROUP BY client_id;
SELECT clients.name, SUM(expenses,amount) FROM expenses JOIN clients ON expenses.client_id = clients.id 
GROUP BY client_id;

SELECT year(expense_date, month(expense_date), SUM(amount) 
FROM expenses GROUP BY year(expense_date), month(expense_date);

SELECT year(expense_date), SUM(amount) FROM expenses GROUP BY expense_date;
